# MeshNet AI Whitepaper

**Version 0.1 â€” July 2025**

MeshNet AI is a decentralized protocol that uses quorum-governed AI agents to protect on-chain infrastructure. This repository hosts the official lightweight whitepaper outlining the architectural framework, use cases, and roadmap.
# MeshNet AI: A Lightweight Whitepaper  
**Version 0.1 â€” July 2025**  

---

## Abstract  
MeshNet AI introduces a decentralized security protocol powered by quorum-governed AI. Designed to detect, validate, and act on-chain threats in real time, MeshNet leverages user device consensus to limit autonomous AI action, creating a new paradigm of permissioned machine intelligence. This framework ensures decentralization extends into security, with no single point of failure or trust.

---

## 1. The Problem  
Despite the ideals of decentralization, most on-chain systems still rely on centralized bridges, wrapped assets, opaque governance, or unverifiable smart contracts. Even where trustless computation exists, security layers are reactive and siloed. The emergence of autonomous AI threatens to deepen these risks if allowed to operate without human oversight.

- $3B+ lost annually in protocol exploits  
- Increasing complexity of bridge logic and contract attack surfaces  
- Centralized off-chain AI and security services acting as new middlemen  

---

## 2. The Vision  
MeshNet AI creates an AI-powered mesh of security agents that must pass a human-governed consensus check before acting. This combines:

- Autonomous real-time AI agents  
- A decentralized quorum of validating devices  
- Reputation-weighted scoring mechanisms  
- Incentivized good behavior  

By requiring AI actions to be validated by independent devices in a 10:1 ratio, the protocol enforces permissioned autonomy and provable integrity.

---

## 3. Architecture Overview  

- **Core Agents**: 10 modular AI units monitor contract activity, anomaly patterns, and network states.  
- **Quorum Layer**: Each action requires consensus from a group of 100+ user devices, each running light clients or validation scripts.  
- **Reputation System**: AI agents and validating devices are scored on uptime, accuracy, and consensus alignment.  
- **Failsafe Mesh**: Disconnected fallback agents ensure network redundancy and recovery.  
- **Optional Value Layer**: Trust anchoring via BTC staking (native, not wrapped).  

---

## 4. Use Cases  

- Pre-bridge validation layers (AI can't greenlight transfers without quorum)  
- Protocol defense against contract logic manipulation  
- DAO tooling: quorum-enhanced autonomous governance agents  
- On-chain monitoring dashboards with public audit trails  

---

## 5. Token & Incentives (Proposed)  

A native utility token or BTC-staked reputation score powers:

- Validator incentives  
- AI agent registration  
- Dispute arbitration via staking slashing  
- Long-term sustainability for contributors  

---

## 6. Roadmap Preview  

- **Phase 0 (Now)**: Conceptualization, site launch, contributor intake  
- **Phase 1**: Form core protocol schema + test validation logic  
- **Phase 2**: MVP deployment w/ dummy agents and public validators  
- **Phase 3**: BTC integration, formal audits, governance bootstrap  

---

## 7. Call to Collaborators  

We are seeking early contributors across:

- On-chain security and exploit detection  
- AI/ML developers with experience in agentic systems
